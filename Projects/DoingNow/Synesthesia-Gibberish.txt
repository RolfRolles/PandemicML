What does it actually mean when we say that we want to create a shellcode, subject to a particular set of character restrictions, that does something specific?

Let's break that down.
* Create a shellcode...

A shellcode is a program:  a machine code program.  Machine code is what results from assembling an assembly language program.  To be specific:  our task is to *create a machine/assembly language program*.

* Subject to a particular set of character restrictions.

The machine code bytes must satisfy some specific condition in order to be valid.  Example conditions:

-Contains no NULL bytes
-Contains no 25 '%' bytes
-Is alphanumeric
-Is Utf-8
-Is Unicode
-Etc.

* A shellcode that does something specific.

When we say that it "does something specific", we mean that we have a "specification" of what the program is supposed to do when we run it.

* Create a machine-code program from within the space of legal byte sequences that accomplishes a task of my choosing when executed.
