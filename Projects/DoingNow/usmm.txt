Cooler name:  to be determined.

Executive summary of planned solution:

1)  Input: a collection of straight-line code sequences in binary form
2)  Process the sequences and extract repeatedly-occuring patterns
*   Should we generalize at this point, or wait?
3)  Generate functional fingerprints
4)  Compare fingerprints against reference sequences
5)  Prove equivalence using a theorem prover

Several thorns that are sticking out right off the bat:

How do we deal with "generalizations"?

add eax, 1234h
add eax, ebx
sub eax, 1234h

In this case, our system would ideally determine several facts:

a)  The sequence has equivalent register semantics to add eax, ebx
b)
