What do I need to make this work?

* Abstract operand x86 sequence => concrete, sandboxed x86 sequence

* Canonicalizer needs to take subregisters into account

* Find and fix the bug involving "negated constants"

* Live variables for the sequence generator.

* I need to modify my JIT compiler/results generator to return me all of the
  registers, not just a few of them.
  
  Ideally, I need to set each register EXCEPT ESP to a random value before the
  sequence executes, and store the results of all registers after the sequence
  has executed.
  
* Custom hash-table for instruction results with liveness information

* Custom memory <> disk storage
