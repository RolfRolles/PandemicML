Known bugs in X86Decode:

OK ... it seems like the presence of the byte 0x9B, which decodes to WAIT (synonymous with FWAIT), changes the mnemonic of six other instructions:

| Finit  (* | Fninit when paired with Wait *)  DB NO OPERANDS
| Fclex  (* | Fnclex when paired with Wait *)  DB NO OPERANDS
| Fstcw  (* | Fnstcw when paired with Wait *)  D9 oEw
| Fstenv (* | Fnstenv when paired with Wait *) D9 oFPEnvLow
| Fsave  (* | Fnsave when paired with Wait *)  DD oFPEnv
| Fstsw  (* | Fnstsw when paired with Wait *)  DF oEw or oAX

Ghetto way of doing this:
Decode instruction
  let ((m,o) as i) = decode table_index in
  match m with
  | Wait ->
    let curr_ea = get_cursor () in
    let nb = consume_byte () in
    match nb with
    | 0xDBl | 0xD9l | 0xDDl | 0xDFl -> 
      let ((m2,o2) as i2) = decode (Int32.to_int nb) in
     (match m2 with
      | 
    | _ -> decr_ea ()
  | _ ->

This is fucking complicated.  I'm going to bed.
